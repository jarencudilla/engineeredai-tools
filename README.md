# EngineeredAI Toolbox
AI without the BS.

This repo hosts experiments, sarcastic 404 templates, structured data tests, and random AI toys featured on [EngineeredAI.net](https://engineeredai.net/tools).

## What’s Inside
- **404-designs** → sarcastic error pages AI mocked up
- **schema-experiments** → JSON-LD / structured data for LLM visibility
- **prompt-toys** → tactical prompts worth reusing
- **novelty** → pointless, sarcastic, entertaining AI builds

## Philosophy
EngineeredAI is about showing the guts, not selling the hype.
If it works, break it down. If it’s useless, make it funny.

Pull requests welcome — if you can keep the sarcasm sharp.
